The main weakness of DES is its short key. It thus makes sense to try to
design a block cipher with a larger key length using DES as a building block.
Some approaches to doing so are discussed in this section. Although we refer
to DES frequently throughout the discussion, and DES is the most prominent
block cipher to which these techniques have been applied, everything we say
here applies generically to any block cipher.
